# CodingGirls

CodingGirls, featured by Fondazione Mondo Digitale, is an educational initiative that aim to introduce high schoolers to programming, data science, and analytical thinking. The program combined lectures, tutorials, and a final hackathon at Università degli Studi di Milano, where students applied what they learned and presented their project to a panel of judges from academia and industry. 

**Program:**
- Statistics: fundamentals of probability, descriptive and inferential analysis.
- Programming: Python and R programming using Jupyter Notebooks and R studio.
- Data Manipulation: working with data using pandas and NumPy.
- Data Visualization: exploring insights with matplotlib and seaborn.
- Support for data collection and data visualization for final Hackathon

I was invited to present CodingGirls at the **STEM Women Congress**, where I discussed the program’s impact and the importance of early exposure to coding and data literacy among young women.
The initiative has also been featured in the press:
